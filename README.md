This is a lisp I'm building in C using the guide http://buildyourownlisp.com/

`make build` to build, `make run` to run the repl, and `make` to do both.

## Tests

Install check, a unit testing framework, by following [these instructions](http://check.sourceforge.net/web/install.html).

Run tests with:

```sh
make test
```
